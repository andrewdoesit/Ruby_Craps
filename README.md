A simple Craps game built in ruby. Establishes a point and then rolls till point
is met or a seven is rolled..

Im currently working on this Game I still need to get all the bets working.
Also I need to stop the looping and ask for more user input.

I am using this project as my tester as I figure out github and more about 
the processes of programming
